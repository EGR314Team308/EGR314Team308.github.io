#Appendix A: Team Organization



<b>Communication Procedures<b>
Our team will communicate primarily through Discord on a regular basis. It will be expected for team members to check for updates daily. In the absence of a response over Discord, we will send messages with a group text. 
If any team member personally receives correspondence from the instructor relating to the group, they will be responsible for notifying the rest of the team. This will primarily be done using Discord, and main information that is obtained through email will be forwarded and/ or carbon copied. 
Our team membersâ€™ phone numbers and emails can be found in the chart below and our team discord has been made. Everyone has been added, but if there are difficulties here is the invite link: https://discord.gg/97bPcvWd
  
  
<b>Meeting Coordination<b>
We will have scheduled meetings put on a shared team calendar. Meetings will be added or changed after everyone agrees on it. If things get brought up and one or more people cannot make the scheduled times, we will set up the meeting on zoom and/ or communicate the discussion and project needs in meeting notes shared on the discord and google drive. We all agree that everyone has lives and unexpected circumstances. Meetings will start 10 minutes after the scheduled time. Anyone not in attendance will be reminded. 
Since the class, and team, requires hands-on work, we will be meeting in person for all of our meetings. If needed members should be able to propose new procedures if needed.
  
  
<b>Team Coordination<b>
Our team will use discord to verify that assignments are submitted before the deadlines and that each team member approves of the assignments. If team members do not have the required knowledge or skills required for each assignment we will discuss it within the team and if that does not work we will talk to the professor. Our team will meet through discord to make sure that we distribute the work equally and that each team member knows what they are assigned to.
