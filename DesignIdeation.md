<b>Generate Ideas</b>
<br>
The team was tasked with creating ideas of how our project could work. The images below are the ideas generated with this project in mind. No ideas were put down, so each member was tasked with creating as many ideas as possible knowing that each had to come up with 25, or so, ideas to meet the group quota. The group used Google Jamboard to remotely collaborate on these ideas.
