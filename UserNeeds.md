<h1><b>User Needs</b><h1>
<br><br>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
This document serves as the holder for research and organization of user requirements. The team has done research with the final project and users in mind. This will serve as the voice of the customer and will dictate how Team 308 will plan their project. Since the class will not have much contact with any hypothetical customers, the team will gather what they like and need in a solar powered outdoor data collector and safety regulations on it. From this the team will develop the requirements for the project, and carry these in mind instead of being in contact with a target audience.

<b>Voice of the Customer Benchmarking</b>
<br>
This is the research for products already on the market. For each at least one positive and negative comment will be taken and analyzed. User needs will be brought from the comments. Below is that process with five products on the market today.
