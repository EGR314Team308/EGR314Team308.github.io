<h1><b>User Needs</b></h1>
<br>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br><br>
This document serves as the holder for research and organization of user requirements. The team has done research with the final project and users in mind. This will serve as the voice of the customer and will dictate how Team 308 will plan their project. Since the class will not have much contact with any hypothetical customers, the team will gather what they like and need in a solar powered outdoor data collector and safety regulations on it. From this the team will develop the requirements for the project, and carry these in mind instead of being in contact with a target audience.

<b>Voice of the Customer Benchmarking</b>
<br><br>
This is the research for products already on the market. For each at least one positive and negative comment will be taken and analyzed. User needs will be brought from the comments. Below is that process with five products on the market today.

<br><br>
<b>Organize</b>
<br><br>
The team initially took all the comments gathered from the separate products and put them into a Google Jamboard (See screenshot below) looking at all of the needs, five categories were found to sort them into: hardware, software, user interaction, safety, and user desires. Although some needs could fit into two, or more, categories, all but two were eventually fitted into categories.
<br><br>

The five categories, as mentioned before, are hardware, software, user interaction, safety, and user desires. Hardware being the electrical components inside and how they are put together. This includes soldering, component selection, pcb manufacturing, and buttons. Outer shells, any paint, or any cosmetic features will not be included in this category. Software being the inevitable coding involved with this project. This category includes all the internal calculations that are needed and the outputs given to the hardware. User interaction includes the parts that the user will use to use the final design. Safety includes things such as the outer shell, the interaction with weather, and any interaction from the user to the electronics. User desires is a miscellaneous category of requirements that couldnâ€™t fit into any categories, but are still important.
