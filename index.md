<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/TeamOrganization.html"><u>Team Organization</u></a></h3>

Our team first evaluated the needs of the project and assessed the syllabus to consider academic points that will need to be touched base this semester. It is incredibly important that every team member is aware of the requirements of this courses expectations. Therefore, a list of five different team charter points was created to focus on during the semester. Each point ensures the success of each team memeber in this course along with the success as a team. As a team, following these team charter points is very beneficial to the quality and achievement of our course project. We have a set goal that we will work on achieving thorught the semester by implementing our team charter onto our weather monitoring system. The teams main goal is to use our skills and knowledge and implement it into our project. 

<br>

<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/UserNeeds.html"><u>User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements</u></a></h3>

After careful consideration of our mission statement and charter, we later moved onto laying out potential user needs and requirements that are needed to the prototype. To create user needs, we used existing customer comments to similiar products to capture thier needs and recognize solutions to thier issues. This allowed us to create the most precise user needs and solutions to create a product that serves customer satisfaction and user friendliness. The user needs collected and created were then organized and tranferred into a clear list that will be focused on thorught the creation of this project. By doing this, it allows us to use engineering skills to enable these needs within our prototype. 
 
<br> 

<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/DesignIdeation.html"><u>Design Ideation</u></a></h3>

After creating a list of user needs and requirements, we created three designs for consideration for the final prototype. Each team member proposed ideas in a general basis and as a team, we created three different ideas that this project could be based off of. Brainstorming together as a team was very beneficial as it inspired new ideas and some designs that were created were combinations of two different ideas. As a team, we were then able to protoype complete draft designs that fit the needs of the project requirement and are possible candidates for a final design concept that will be implemented into a physical protoype by the end of this semester. 

<br>

<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/SelectedDesign.html"><u>Selected Design</u></a></h3>


On choosing a design for our project, our team worked together. With our ideation sessions, we started by thinking and producing a range of design choices. Next, after carefully examining each design, we chose the best one based on its advantages, how well it satisfied the project's criteria, and whether it was within the allotted budget. We gathered the opinions of every team member before making a decision, allowing us to take into account all viewpoints and insights. By involving the whole team in this process, we made sure that everyone had a say and that everyone supported the final design. In the end, we are convinced that the design we have selected will be successful in accomplishing the project's goals.


<br>

<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/BlockDiagram.html"><u>Block Diagram</u></a></h3>

The block diagram is an essential component that will graphically represent the key elements of each subsystem and show how they will work together to create the finished result. This thorough strategy will act as the framework for our project, clearly and succinctly laying out how the work and components will be distributed. We will give a thorough overview of the product, displaying how each component works into the bigger system as well as highlighting its features and potential. With the use of our block diagram, which will be a crucial presentation tool, we will be able to show how each subsystem works in concert with the others to accomplish a shared objective. 

<br>

<h3><a href="https://egr314-team308.github.io/CompSelectApp.html"><u>Component Selection</u></a></h3>

Our team had to carefully study and assess numerous important components for each subsystem as part of the component selection process. Our team chose the components with an uncompromising focus on quality, a sharp eye for detail, and a well-thought-out justification that guaranteed their ideal performance and compatibility with the system. It is important to note that the microcontroller selection procedure was carried out independently and will be covered in a separate section. 
These components are mostly set in stone. Each person in the group is free to choose another component as long as it is represented in the current documents. As the team sees it, this portion of the project is complete, because all persons on the team have made individual schematics and combined them into the hardware proposal.

<h3><u>System Verification</u></h3>
   
   <p><img src="Completed_Verification_Table.JPG" style="width20%;height:20%" /></p>
   
<br>
   
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
   
1. Solder oven staions<br>
   Surface mount comonents are small and there is very little room on the footprints for error. using the solder paste and oven is safer and there is little risk for damaging the parts since the only heat comes from the oven where the tempature and exposure to heat is exact and timed.
   The throughhole componets (headers, wires, sockets, etc.) cannot go into the ovens, so the surface mount components must go first.
   
2. Serial Digital Communication<br>
   When working with many inputs at a time, mutiple clocks, MOSI, and MISO pins might not be avalible. Being able to turn off and on the subsystems to only communicate with one is helpful to use. The software and hardware have to be in working order to make this communication work.
   Many datasheets that explain hhow to efficiently use digital communication in the firmware, but knowing how to accomplish this consepually makes the process more streamlined.
   
3. Using Cadence<br>
   Cadence is a confusing software at first, but having knowlage about an industry professional software can be helpful. 
   
4. Ordering Excess Parts<br>
  The team learned that it is important to order plenty of parts to ensure that there is enough. This is so the team can still have enough parts in the event that a part doesn't work. Not having enough parts can delay the functionality of a subsystem and cause many issues. 
   
5. Quality Assurance<br>
   The group discovered how crucial it is to carry out thorough quality verification on the PCB before attaching any components to it. The team was able to find any flaws by doing a continuity check before they became major ones later on in the design phase. This made it easier to make sure the finished item was correctly designed and performed as anticipated.

<h3>Recommendations for future students</h3>
   Here are some suggestions to assist students who are enrolled in EGR 314, an embedded system design course that requires them to develop a project for a mobile weather station:
<br>
     <br>
1.  Getting Started Early: Embedded system design takes a lot of time and work. It is advised to begin the project as soon as possible, thoroughly comprehend the project's needs, develop the design, and order all essential parts. Starting early will also give you ample time to debug and address any problems that may come up while you are designing and testing.
   <br>
     <br>
  2.  If at all possible, avoid picking tiny project components since they are hard to handle and are more likely to cause mistakes. A preferable option is a component with leads or contact pads on the bottom. Before choosing which parts to use, it's crucial to make sure that all of the components share the same level of logic in order to prevent issues with integration.
  <br>
     <br>
3.       Learn the fundamentals of PCB design because this course requires you to create a PCB, thus you must be familiar with these ideas. Students might begin by becoming familiar with the various PCB parts, schematics, and designing tools. They can get started with the help of numerous online resources, tutorials, and videos.
<br>
     <br>
4.           Work together as a team: Collaborating on a project as a team can be difficult yet vital. To keep everyone on the same page, students should organize regular meetings, distribute duties appropriately, and use good communication with their team members. For the project to be finished, cooperation is crucial.
   <br>
     <br>
5.   Ordering additional parts in plenty of quantity is advised. The rigorous hardware design and debugging required for the course increases the likelihood of component failure. By ordering extra components, you may cut down on the time, money, and delays that come with buying hardware.
   
  <br>
   <br>
6.    Early and frequent testing is essential to the design of embedded systems. Every step of the design process should include testing the PCB and subsystems created by the students. By doing this, they will be able to see any concerns early on and address them.
  <br>
   <br>
7.     Embedded system design may be complicated, and students may run into issues they are unable to resolve on their own. Don't be hesitant to ask for assistance. They shouldn't be embarrassed to approach their teacher or fellow students for assistance. They may offer insightful advice and recommendations that might support students in overcoming any challenges they may run across.
<br>
     <br>
   Students can develop a useful mobile weather station and pass the course by adhering to these suggestions. It's crucial to retain an open mind, absorb lessons from errors, and find pleasure in the process.
