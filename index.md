[Team Organization](TeamOrganization.md)

First, as a team, we evaluated the needs of the project sequence and reviewed the course syllabus to consider academic points that we need to touch base this semester. It very important that each team member knows the requirements of this course and what is expected. Therefore, we created five different team charter points to focus on thorught the semester. Each point ensures the success of each team memeber in this course along with the success as a team. As a team, following these team charter points is very beneficial to the quality and achievement of our course project. We have a set goal that we will work on achieving thorught the semester by implementing our team charter onto our weather monitoring system. The teams main goal is to use our skills and knowledge and implement it into our project.

[User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeeds.md)

After we considered out charter and mission statement, we later moved onto laying out possible user needs and requirements that are needed to the prototype. To create user needs, we used existing customer comments to related product to truly capture thier needs and remedy issues they had. This enable us to create the most accurate user needs and solutions to create a product that serves customer satisfaction and user friendliness. The user needs collected and created were then organized and tranferred into a clear list that will be focused on thorught the creation of this project. By doing this, it allows us to use engineering skills to enable these needs within our prototype.

[Design Ideation](DesignIdeation.md)

After creating a list of user needs and requirements, we created three designs for consideration for the final prototype. Each team member proposed ideas in a general basis and as a team, we created three different ideas that this project could be based off of. Brainstorming together as a team was very beneficial as it inspired new ideas and some designs that were created were combinations of two different ideas. As a team, we were then able to protoype complete draft designs that fit the needs of the project requirement and are possible candidates for a final design concept that will be implemented into a physical protoype by the end of this semester.

[Presentation 1](Presentation1.md)

A recorded video of our project presentation was created to recap the work we have done so far for the project and the procedures we took to create designs. The presentation also recaps and explains the designs we created and how they were designed by the team.
