[Team Organization](TeamOrganization.md)

First, as a team, we evaluated the needs of the project sequence and reviewed the course syllabus to consider academic points that we need to touch base this semester. It very important that each team member knows the requirements of this course and what is expected. Therefore, we created five different team charter points to focus on thorught the semester. Each point ensures the success of each team memeber in this course along with the success as a team. As a team, following these team charter points is very beneficial to the quality and achievement of our course project. We have a set goal that we will work on achieving thorught the semester by implementing our team charter onto our weather monitoring system. The teams main goal is to use our skills and knowledge and implement it into our project.
