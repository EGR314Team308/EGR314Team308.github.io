  The ability to adapt and react to changing settings is becoming more and more crucial in today's society, particularly in the fields of robotics and automation. Serial sensing and actuation systems are posing as a viable option in this situation for creating machines that can interact with their environment and modify their behavior as necessary. These systems combine sensors and actuators to monitor changes in the environment and react to those changes.

  This project's goal is to investigate the creation of systems for serial sensing and actuation for a range of uses, such as robotics, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. We seek to create and build responsive systems that can adapt to the surrounding environment and increase overall efficiency and effectiveness by utilizing the most recent developments in sensors, actuators, and control algorithms. Our goal is to design systems that can not only detect and respond to changes in the environment but also learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time.

  A multidisciplinary approach will be used for the project, combining the knowledge of specialists in both electrical engineering and robotic engineering. The ultimate objective is to develop intelligent, autonomous systems that will enhance human interaction with the environment and pave the way for a more sustainable future.




[Team Organization](TeamOrganization.md)

First, as a team, we evaluated the needs of the project sequence and reviewed the course syllabus to consider academic points that we need to touch base this semester. It very important that each team member knows the requirements of this course and what is expected. Therefore, we created five different team charter points to focus on thorught the semester. Each point ensures the success of each team memeber in this course along with the success as a team. As a team, following these team charter points is very beneficial to the quality and achievement of our course project. We have a set goal that we will work on achieving thorught the semester by implementing our team charter onto our weather monitoring system. The teams main goal is to use our skills and knowledge and implement it into our project.

[User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements](UserNeeds.md)

After we considered out charter and mission statement, we later moved onto laying out possible user needs and requirements that are needed to the prototype. To create user needs, we used existing customer comments to related product to truly capture thier needs and remedy issues they had. This enable us to create the most accurate user needs and solutions to create a product that serves customer satisfaction and user friendliness. The user needs collected and created were then organized and tranferred into a clear list that will be focused on thorught the creation of this project. By doing this, it allows us to use engineering skills to enable these needs within our prototype. 

<br> 

[Design Ideation](DesignIdeation.md)

After creating a list of user needs and requirements, we created three designs for consideration for the final prototype. Each team member proposed ideas in a general basis and as a team, we created three different ideas that this project could be based off of. Brainstorming together as a team was very beneficial as it inspired new ideas and some designs that were created were combinations of two different ideas. As a team, we were then able to protoype complete draft designs that fit the needs of the project requirement and are possible candidates for a final design concept that will be implemented into a physical protoype by the end of this semester. 

<br>

[Selected Design](SelectedDesign.md)


On choosing a design for our project, our team worked together. With our ideation sessions, we started by thinking and producing a range of design choices. Next, after carefully examining each design, we chose the best one based on its advantages, how well it satisfied the project's criteria, and whether it was within the allotted budget. We gathered the opinions of every team member before making a decision, allowing us to take into account all viewpoints and insights. By involving the whole team in this process, we made sure that everyone had a say and that everyone supported the final design. In the end, we are convinced that the design we have selected will be successful in accomplishing the project's goals.

[Block Diagram](BlockDiagram.md)

The block diagram will show the major components of each subsystem and how they all come together. This will serve as the plan and main presentation of the final product, including distribution of work and components.  

<br>

[Component Selection](ComponentSelection.md)

The component selection is where the team chose different major components for their subsystems. Each one has a different rationale for being chosen over the others. This will not include the microcontroller; that is a separate page. 

<br>

[Microcontroller Selection](MicrocontrollerSelection.md)

The microcontroller selection provides insight to how the team narrowed down and chose the microcontroller we will be using for the project.

<br>

[Software Proposal](SoftwareProposal.md)

This proposal is meant to show how the microcontroller is meant to be programmed and make all the components do their jobs. This is basically the program of our final project.

<br>

[Hardware Proposal](HardwareProposal.md)

This proposal is meant to show how all the components are meant to work together. This is basically the electrical design of our final project.

<br>


[Presentation 1](Presentation1.md)

A recorded video of our project presentation was created to recap the work we have done so far for the project and the procedures we took to create designs. The presentation also recaps and explains the designs we created and how they were designed by the team.
