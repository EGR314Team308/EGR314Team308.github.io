Our team discussed what goals we sought to achieve in EGR 314, either academically or professionally. The goals were listed and the team selected the 5 goals that were the most important to them. These are what make up the Team Charter. 

Team Charter:  
1. Perform well academically in EGR 314 
2. Create a product that successfully functions as a mobile weather station 
3. Have each team member learn new skills in hardware and software
4. Interact with other teams in order to learn new methods and suggestions 
5. Design and construct a product that can be added to each team memberâ€™s portfolio of engineering experience


Taking these five main points, our team will use them to achieve our mission statement which was developed to develop a functional project by the end of the semester. This mission statement is a recap of the the points that we should have succeeded with the conclusion of our project. Throughout the semester, the team should recall this mission statement to seek guidance and motivation. 

Mission Statement:

Team 308 seeks to design and construct a product that functions as a mobile weather station. The goal is for the product to efficiently collect and transmit data from digital sensors through wireless connections. We will be successful when the product can be utilized to accurately and easily collect sensor outputs relating to immediate weather conditions.
