Our team discussed what goals we sought to achieve in EGR 314, either academically or professionally. The goals were listed and the team selected the 5 goals that were the most important to them. These are what make up the Team Charter. First, as a team, we evaluated the needs of the project sequence and reviewed the course syllabus to consider academic points that we need to touch base this semester. It very important that each team member knows the requirements of this course and what is expected. Therefore, we created five different team charter points to focus on thorught the semester. Each point ensures the success of each team memeber in this course along with the success as a team. As a team, following these team charter points is very beneficial to the quality and achievement of our course project. We have a set goal that we will work on achieving thorught the semester by implementing our team charter onto our weather monitoring system. The teams main goal is to use our skills and knowledge and implement it into our project. 

Team Charter:  
1. Perform well academically in EGR 314 
2. Create a product that successfully functions as a mobile weather station 
3. Have each team member learn new skills in hardware and software
4. Interact with other teams in order to learn new methods and suggestions 
5. Design and construct a product that can be added to each team memberâ€™s portfolio of engineering experience


Taking these five main points, our team will use them to achieve our mission statement which was developed to develop a functional project by the end of the semester. This mission statement is a recap of the the points that we should have succeeded with the conclusion of our project. Throughout the semester, the team should recall this mission statement to seek guidance and motivation. 

Mission Statement:
Team 308 seeks to design and construct a product that functions as a mobile weather station. The goal is for the product to efficiently collect and transmit data from digital sensors through wireless connections. We will be successful when the product can be utilized to accurately and easily collect sensor outputs relating to immediate weather conditions.
